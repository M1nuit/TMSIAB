;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; About php.ini   ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; This file controls many aspects of PHP's behavior.  In order for PHP to
; read it, it must be named 'php.ini'.  PHP looks for it in the current
; working directory, in the path designated by the environment variable
; PHPRC, and in the path that was defined in compile time (in that order).
; Under Windows, the compile-time path is the Windows directory.  The
; path in which the php.ini file is looked for can be overridden using
; the -c argument in command line mode.
;
; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and Lines
; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).
; Section headers (e.g. [Foo]) are also silently ignored, even though
; they might mean something in the future.
;
; Directives are specified using the following syntax:
; directive = value
; Directive names are *case sensitive* - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.
;
; The value can be a string, a number, a PHP constant (e.g. E_ALL or M_PI), one
; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None) or an expression
; (e.g. E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE), or a quoted string ("foo").
;
; Expressions in the INI file are limited to bitwise operators and parentheses:
; |        bitwise OR
; &        bitwise AND
; ~        bitwise NOT
; !        boolean NOT
;
; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes.
; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No.
;
; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal
; sign, or by using the None keyword:
;
;  foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string
;  foo = none    ; sets foo to an empty string
;  foo = "none"  ; sets foo to the string 'none'
;
; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a
; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension),
; you may only use these constants *after* the line that loads the extension.
; 
;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; About this file ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; This is the recommended, PHP 5-style version of the php.ini-dist file.  It
; sets some non standard settings, that make PHP more efficient, more secure,
; and encourage cleaner coding.
;
; The price is that with these settings, PHP may be incompatible with some
; applications, and sometimes, more difficult to develop with.  Using this
; file is warmly recommended for production sites.  As all of the changes from
; the standard settings are thoroughly documented, you can go over each one,
; and decide whether you want to use it or not.
;
; For general information about the php.ini file, please consult the php.ini-dist
; file, included in your PHP distribution.
;
; This file is different from the php.ini-dist file in the fact that it features
; different values for several directives, in order to improve performance, while
; possibly breaking compatibility with the standard out-of-the-box behavior of
; PHP.  Please make sure you read what's different, and modify your scripts
; accordingly, if you decide to use this file instead.
;
; - register_long_arrays = Off     [Performance]
;     Disables registration of the older (and deprecated) long predefined array
;     variables ($HTTP_*_VARS).  Instead, use the superglobals that were
;     introduced in PHP 4.1.0
; - display_errors = Off           [Security]
;     With this directive set to off, errors that occur during the execution of
;     scripts will no longer be displayed as a part of the script output, and thus,
;     will no longer be exposed to remote users.  With some errors, the error message
;     content may expose information about your script, web server, or database
;     server that may be exploitable for hacking.  Production sites should have this
;     directive set to off.
; - log_errors = On                [Security]
;     This directive complements the above one.  Any errors that occur during the
;     execution of your script will be logged (typically, to your server's error log,
;     but can be configured in several ways).  Along with setting display_errors to off,
;     this setup gives you the ability to fully understand what may have gone wrong,
;     without exposing any sensitive information to remote users.
; - output_buffering = 4096        [Performance]
;     Set a 4KB output buffer.  Enabling output buffering typically results in less
;     writes, and sometimes less packets sent on the wire, which can often lead to
;     better performance.  The gain this directive actually yields greatly depends
;     on which Web server you're working with, and what kind of scripts you're using.
; - register_argc_argv = Off       [Performance]
;     Disables registration of the somewhat redundant $argv and $argc global
;     variables.
; - magic_quotes_gpc = Off         [Performance]
;     Input data is no longer escaped with slashes so that it can be sent into
;     SQL databases without further manipulation.  Instead, you should use the
;     database vendor specific escape string function on each input element you 
;     wish to send to a database.
; - variables_order = "GPCS"       [Performance]
;     The environment variables are not hashed into the $_ENV.  To access
;     environment variables, you can use getenv() instead.
; - error_reporting = E_ALL        [Code Cleanliness, Security(?)]
;     By default, PHP suppresses errors of type E_NOTICE.  These error messages
;     are emitted for non-critical errors, but that could be a symptom of a bigger
;     problem.  Most notably, this will cause error messages about the use
;     of uninitialized variables to be displayed.
; - allow_call_time_pass_reference = Off     [Code cleanliness]
;     It's not possible to decide to force a variable to be passed by reference
;     when calling a function.  The PHP 4 style to do this is by making the
;     function require the relevant argument by reference.
; - short_open_tag = Off           [Portability]
;     Using short tags is discouraged when developing code meant for redistribution
;     since short tags may not be supported on the target server.

; Output buffering allows you to send header lines (including cookies) even

; setting this directive to On.  If you wish to limit the size of the buffer
; to a certain size - you can use a maximum number of bytes instead of 'On', as
; a value for this directive (e.g., output_buffering=4096).

; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini

;       outputs chunks that are few hundreds bytes each as a result of
;       compression. If you prefer a larger chunk size for better
;       performance, enable output_buffering in addition.
