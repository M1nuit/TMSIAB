----------------- BASIC CONFIG ----------------
you can replace a running aseco/rasp/mistral environment.
this script is based on aseco 0.61b or 1.x(?) and rasp 1.2a

if you have aseco/rasp/mistral script running already ...
REPLACE ALL FILES! (except config.xml if you want)

1. add tables from aseco\db directory
- newdb	(new installation only)
- updatedb (update existing aseco/rasp/mistral-environment)
	* ignore evt. errors about
		mistral_playerwins
		teams
		mistral_billing
		rs_times
2. edit config.xml
3. edit localdatabase.xml
4. edit includes\rasp_settings.php
5. after first start you should press "clean&save"

-------- CHANGE FOR YOUR NEEDS ----------------
- customize function cleanupdb($aseco, $player)
 + in default, chat will be deleted except last 5000 lines

----------------- optional -------------------------
- copy mistralweb directory contents to a webserver
- edit mychat.php and teval.php

mychat.php: livechat of your sever
teval.php: overview over trackevaluation results (worst tracks ontop)

------------ more interesting stuff ----------------
- jukebox and buffer are saved -> will survive script crash/restart
- disconnected players will be kicked automatically so they can rejoin
- voting is disabled if an admin is online
- no logfile is written from the script (redirect console output if needed)

be fair and DO NOT TOUCH THE EASTEREGG.
